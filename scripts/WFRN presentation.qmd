- desire to stay in a relationship is reflected in individuals’ investments in the relationship\

Pooling also seems to contribute to relationship quality\

Married mixed-gender couples are more likely to report they ‘put all of their money together’ compared with married same-gender couples.

Brings up some questions about potential differences in stability and quality of same and mixed gender couples.
:::

##  {#slide3-id data-menu-title="RQs"}

<h3>Research Questions</h3>

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
1.  Is the gap in income pooling accounted for by variation in demographic characteristics?\
2.  Do the associations between pooling and relationship stability and quality vary by the gender composition of the couple?\
:::

::: {.content-visible when-profile="speaker"}
::: notes
[**\<click\>**]{style="color: #E74C3C;"}\
First RQ: \[read it\]\
Descriptive differences in the subpopulations:\
- men partnered with men are less likely to be living with a child.\
- Pooling is more common in breadwinner/homemaker work family arrangements, which might vary by couple-type.\
- Relative earnings differences is also gendered, which might have implications for pooling.\

[**\<click\>**]{style="color: #E74C3C;"}\
Second RQ \[read it\]\
Divisions of housework/childcare are different for same-gender couples than mixed-gender.\
Meanings of relationship traits are also different at times.\
Wondering if the same is true about financial integration.

In sum, we're asking about prevelance differences and implication differences.

Most important for our purposes, is that the survey over-sampled same-gender couples so we have an adequate sample size.

Constructed 3 relationship scales.\
**Instability** test if stability is different based on subjective measures compared with marital status.\

This table show the weighted descriptive statistics of the sample.\
Different-gender couples are more likely to be married and parents than same-gender couples.\
Respondents in different gender couples are also more likely to report they are White.\
There's not a clear pattern of differences in the proportion of dual-earners.\
For the relationship scales, bigger numbers equal worse outcomes.\
Across couple type, they look fairly similar, maybe slightly elevated scores among same-gender couples.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="speaker"}
::: notes
Answering our first research question, logistic regression results show same-gender couples remain less likely than mixed-gender couples to report full financial pooling, even after adjusting for differences in demographic characteristics, relationship stability, and relationship quality scales.

In the following figures, we show predicted probabilities of pooling from interaction effects from these full models (all controls).

::: {.content-visible when-profile="speaker"}
::: notes
If you look at the green bar all the way to your right, you'll see about 45% of woman-woman married couples are expected to fully pool their money, after adjusting for all model controls.

As shown in this figure, this is a statistically significantly lower probability than mixed-gendered married couples.\
Cohabiting couples of all types are less likely to pool all finances, compared with their married counterparts.

Before I move on to the relationship scales, I want to mention here that I also looked at differences by work-family arrangements, and didn't find much variation by couple-type.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="speaker"}
::: notes
When we look at the probability of pooling and average levels of instability, dissatisfaction, and negativity, so holding these constant at the average, a similar story emerges.\
Woman-woman couples remained statistically less likely than mixed-gender couples to report full financial pooling.\
Hint of a lower probability for man-man couples, but the standard errors are larger, meaning there is likely greater variation.

So far, this is a story of differences in intercepts.\
Let's take a look at variation in slopes.

<h3>Variation in probability of pooling by couple-type and relationship scales</h3>

[![](../images/fig03.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}](https://github.com/jrpepin/NCHAT_pooling/blob/main/images/fig03.png)

::: {.content-visible when-profile="speaker"}
::: notes
Starting with the first panel on your left, it's not surprising, for all couples, the odds of pooling money were significantly lower with greater instability.\

Moving to the middle panel, the same pattern is present for the relationship dissatisfaction scale, with one exception.\
Among men partnered with men, higher levels of dissatisfaction were associated with greater odds of pooling money.\

In the final panel on the right, we see negativity and pooling money showed a positive rather than negative association, across all couple types.\
  
The positive slopes are counter to theory, which makes us wonder if it says something about the directionality of the association?  
Could it be that pooling finances leads to more negative interactions among all couple types and dissatisfaction among men-men couples?  
:::

# Implications

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   Couple-type gap in pooling is [**not explained by demographic differences**]{style="color: #E74C3C;"}, nor necessarily indicative of lower relationship stability and quality.\
-   Relationship stability and quality might be [**differently associated**]{style="color: #E74C3C;"} with financial integration among all couples.\
:::

::: {.content-visible when-profile="speaker"}
::: notes
Using mixed-gender couples’ level of financial integration as a reference point may provide misleading interpretations regarding the stability and relationship quality among same-gender couples.
